# OldUnit
A unit testing framework for old Vb6 applications
20180424 I am working on a Vb6 website, since Vb6 has no real tracing capabilities, I have written logging code througout the project to understand and check program flow.
OldUnit may work with this system to better manage the older code without having to put logging calls all through the current code
