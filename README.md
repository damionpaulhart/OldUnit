# OldUnit
A unit testing framework for old Vb6 applications

20180424 I am working on a Vb6 website created in 2000, 
since Vb6 has no real tracing capabilities, I have written logging code througout the project to understand and check program flow.

When the webpages are loaded, I can trace the system logic through these log calls by reviewing the text file output, it is not a live debugging environment.

OldUnit may work with this system to better manage the older code without having to put numerours logging calls throughout the current code.
